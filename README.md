# nerdle
Nerdle game in Prolog

This is a sandbox for playing with strategies for playing
https://nerdlegame.com/

The interface is still quite crude. There's an "aid" for playing,
which you can use like this (see also `test_nerdle.pl`). It starts
with an initial guess of
```
6+9-3=12
rrrbrgrb  (response)
```
That is: `6`, `+`, `9`, `1` were red; `-`, `2` were black;
`=` was green. (Red means the tile appears in the answer but
at a different location; black means it's wrong and doesn't
appear elsewhere; green means that it's correct):
```
swipl nerdle.pl

?- puzzle_solve_all(["6+9-3=12"-"rrrbrgrb"], Ps).
Ps = ["13+46=59","13+76=89","14+69=83","17+39=56","19+37=56","19+64=83","31+64=95","31+67=98","34+61=95","37+19=56","37+61=98","39+17=56","43+16=59","73+16=89","13+36=49"|...].
```
The output is a list of suggestions for the  next guess, with the "best"
one first. So, using that:
```
?- puzzle_solve_all(["6+9-3=12"-"rrrbrgrb", "13+46=59"-"grggrgbr"], Ps).
Ps = ["14+49=63","19+44=63"].

?- puzzle_solve_all(["6+9-3=12"-"rrrbrgrb", "13+46=59"-"grggrgbr", "14+49=63"-"grggrggg"], Ps).
Ps = ["19+44=63"].
```

To run the tests (which are mainly replaying some other games):
```
swipl -g test_nerdle -t halt test_nerdle.pl
```

## The files

`nerdle.pl` - The main program.

`expr.pl` - Parses a guess and validates it

`test_nerdle.pl` - Tests

`gen_all_puzzles.pl` - Generates the file `all_puzzles_facts.pl`,
using the query
`write_all_puzzles('all_puzzles_facts.pl',all_puzzles_facts)`.

`all_puzzles_facts.pl` - An exhaustive list of all possible
puzzles, with a few "trivial" ones removed (e.g., they have
a multiply-by-zero). This is generated by
`gen_all_puzzles:write_all_puzzles/2`.
